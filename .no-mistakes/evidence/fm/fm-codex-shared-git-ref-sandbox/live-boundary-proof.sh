# This guard spends tokens: it runs one real `codex exec` worker under the
# exact -s workspace-write plus --add-dir launch shape fm-spawn composes, and
# proves the worker can create its branch, commit a fixture, publish its
# report and status, and acknowledge its inbox while sibling refs, sibling
# status, and shared Git config stay denied. It refuses to pass without the
# real binary, and it refuses a temp-directory lab because Codex's
# workspace-write sandbox lets model commands write under the temp root,
# which would make every denial assertion vacuous.
