# Live Herdr submit-confirmation guard (live-harness-optin family).
#
# Herdr's native agent_status can stay idle for a whole landed Claude turn, and
# a busy-queued Enter can keep proven pending text visible. Muse can also leave
# the native probe unreadable while a bare U+27E9 composer proves its message
# landed. A stub cannot prove any of those signals. This guard launches real
# Claude Code, and an installed Muse Code on its echo provider, in an isolated
# Herdr lab, requiring fm_backend_herdr_send_text_submit to report empty for
# each landed steer. It fails naming the harness and version rather than
# degrading quietly.
#
# Run explicitly with FM_HERDR_SUBMIT_CONFIRM_LIVE=1 after a Herdr, Claude, or
# Muse upgrade, and before trusting a refreshed
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md "Herdr submit confirmation" entry.
# Every Herdr call, including adapter calls, is routed through bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh.
